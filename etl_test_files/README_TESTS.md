# ETL Pipeline Test Files generated by assistant

Files generated in this folder: /mnt/data/etl_test_files

## How to use these files to test your running service (assumes FastAPI running at 127.0.0.1:8000)

Basic curl upload example (Tier A file):
```
curl -F "file=@/mnt/data/etl_test_files/tierA_simple_kv_json.txt" -F "source_id=test_source" http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload
```

For each file you should expect HTTP 200 and a JSON response similar to:
```
{"status":"ok","source_id":"test_source"}
```
After upload, check schema and records endpoints:
```
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/schema?source_id=test_source"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/schema/history?source_id=test_source"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/records?source_id=test_source&query_id=1"
```

## Automated harness (python)
A simple test harness `test_harness.py` is included to POST each file and print the server response.
Run it like:
```
python test_harness.py
```

Note: test_harness uses `requests`. If it's not installed, either `pip install requests` or run the curl commands above.
